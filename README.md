- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pranjal! Born in Bangladesh ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡©, just finished my Master's from Brock ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building resilient software systems (preferably backend).
- âœ¨ I have worked with Java for 10+ years (4+ years professionally). Also, did numerous personal and academic projects with Python.
- ğŸŒ± I have worked with a major telecommunications networking equipment company in Canada, with their memory related system issues, and tried to figure out how we can anticipate such an issue for better logging, better tracing, better profiling, and better OOM.
