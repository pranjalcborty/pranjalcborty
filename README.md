- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pranjal! Born in Bangladesh ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡©, currently doing my Master's in Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building resilient software systems (preferably backend).
- âœ¨ I have worked with Java for 9 years (4 years professionally). Also, did numerous personal and academic projects with Python.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on memory related system issues (particularly in resource constrained systems) and how we can anticipate such an issue for 1) better logging 2) better tracing 3) better profiling and, (maybe) 4) better OOM!
